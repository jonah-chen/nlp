I'm a complete noob at natural language processing but it sounds really cool. So I downloaded a corpus and I'll try to learn as much as I can with this project.  

Some goals:  
1. I want to start from the basics like processing text, words, sentences, etc. with algorithms efficient enough to expedite the later goals. I also want to analyze the relationship between words and the distribution of their frequency of use.  
2. I want to implement a Word2Vec (Mikolov et. al. 2013) or similar network using one of the popular deep learning libraries like Tensorflow or PyTorch to be able to process and represent words based on their meaning.  
3. I want to write algorithms that use deep learning and the representation of words to do some cool but basic things. Perhaps, some of the things I learned in the process can be used to inform other cool algorithms that's slightly unrelated to N.L.P.  
4. Final Goal: I want to write an A.I. that can complete and pass the Praxis I and II final exams.

It remains quite uncertain where I will get to and how long this will take. However, I value what I know I will learn a lot in the process and for now, as a student, I value the process more than the final result.
